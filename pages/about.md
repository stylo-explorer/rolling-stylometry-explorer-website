Hello everybody,
we are Jonas and Lilly Osburg.
Jonas is a software developer, Lilly is a student at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and is currently working as a student assistant on a project on authorship attribution with stylo R. In the process of this project the Rolling Stylometry Explorer was created.

The Rolling Stylometry Explorer is a web application to visualize rolling.classify results in the analyzed text. It was developed as a tool for use with the [stylo R library](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/stylo) by the [Computational Stylistics Group](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/). For more information on how to install and use the Rolling Stylometry Explorer, check out [the documentation](https://github.com/stylo-explorer/rolling-classify-visualizer/#rolling-stylometry-explorer).
